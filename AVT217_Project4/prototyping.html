            <h2>Importance of Prototyping</h2>
            <p>
                Prototyping is a crucial phase in the Design Thinking process where creative ideas are transformed into tangible representations.
                These prototypes serve as early versions of the final product, allowing designers to visualize and test their concepts.
            </p>
            <p>
                By creating prototypes, designers can quickly iterate and refine their ideas based on feedback. This iterative process helps in
                developing solutions that are well-aligned with user needs and expectations.

            <h2>Benefits of Prototyping</h2>
            <p>
                - Visualization: Prototypes provide a visual representation of design concepts, making it easier for stakeholders to understand the proposed solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                - User Feedback: Testing prototypes with users helps gather valuable feedback, enabling designers to make informed improvements.
            </p>
            <p>
                - Iterative Refinement: The iterative nature of prototyping allows designers to refine and enhance their concepts throughout the design process.
