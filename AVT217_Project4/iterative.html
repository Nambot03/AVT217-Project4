            <h2>The Iterative Nature of Design Thinking</h2>
            <p>
                Design Thinking is inherently iterative, emphasizing continuous improvement and refinement throughout the entire process.
                Iteration involves revisiting earlier steps, incorporating feedback, and making enhancements to create solutions that truly meet user needs.
            </p>
            <p>
                The iterative process ensures that the design evolves based on real-world testing and user insights, leading to more effective and user-centric solutions.

            <h2>Key Components of Iterative Design</h2>
            <p>
                - Feedback Integration: Actively incorporate feedback from user testing into design improvements.
            </p>
            <p>
                - Constant Refinement: Continuously refine and enhance the design based on evolving insights and changing requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
                - Flexibility: Embrace flexibility and openness to change, allowing the design to adapt to emerging insights and user needs.
