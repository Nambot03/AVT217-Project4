            <h2>The Significance of User Testing</h2>
            <p>
                Testing is a pivotal step in the Design Thinking process where designers engage with users to evaluate and gather feedback on prototypes.
                This iterative phase allows designers to assess the usability, functionality, and overall effectiveness of their proposed solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                User testing provides valuable insights that help refine and enhance prototypes, ensuring that the final design meets the needs and expectations of the users.

            <h2>Key Aspects of User Testing</h2>
            <p>
                - Feedback Collection: Actively seek feedback from users to understand their experiences and perspectives.
            </p>
            <p>
                - Observation: Observe user interactions with the prototype to identify areas for improvement.
            </p>
            <p>
                - Iterative Refinement: Use the feedback gathered during testing to iterate and refine the design for optimal user satisfaction.
